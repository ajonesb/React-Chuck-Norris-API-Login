# Devices

The devices screen consists of functionality to show random api calls to a specific api.

Since the api for http://35.201.2.209:8000/ currently has no data to show, mock api is used to randomly show data, in the case of using "devices", here we will show random quotes from https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random
